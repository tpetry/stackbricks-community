# StackBricks
This repository is an issue and feature request tracker for the StackBricks App – [https://stackbricks.app/][1].

If you’d like a less noisy way to stay in the loop with updates, you can subscribe to my [monthly developer newsletter][2] or follow [@stackbricksapp][3] on Twitter.

For the moment, the application is in closed beta-testing. The public beta-testing will start soon.
